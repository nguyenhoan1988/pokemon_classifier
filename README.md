# Prepare Dataset Challenge: pokemon_classifier
Pokemon Classifier for Siraj Raval's coding challenge on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xVqLJe9_CY

##Challenge
The challenge for [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xVqLJe9_CY) is to create a pokemon classifier by their type 1 (i.e fire, water, grass, etc.) using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) pokemon dataset on Kaggle. It will be great practice in data preparation (feature selection, cleaning, etc.)
